# Trivia Generator built with Cohere
This is the code that comes in conjunction with a tutorial to build a React app using [Cohere's](https://cohere.ai) Generate endpoint. Please note that this code isn't a perfect match to what is in the tutorial; I've removed some files and for the purposes of serving it as a sample I've consolidated the client and server into one folder for ease of deployment.

Try it [here](https://cohere-trivia-generator.herokuapp.com/)

Get your API key from Cohere and build your own at [os.cohere.ai/register](https://os.cohere.ai/register).
